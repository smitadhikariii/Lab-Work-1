        	<h1><i>What is Web Design?</i></h1>
        	<p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience 		aspects of website development rather than software development.</p>
        	<p>Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile 		and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
