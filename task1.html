        	<h3><i>Beware of <b>password hackers</b> and <b>crackers</b>!</i></h3>
    		</center>

    		<p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. 
    		If the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group 
    		milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka 
    		jdavis_a, a resident of 
    		<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> 
    		homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, 
    		or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the 
    		Net for more such accounts! <br>Surprised? Or scared?</p>

    		<p>Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got exactly 
    		108 working passwords (and growing daily), 
    		<i>36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet and 23 online passwords.</i></p>
